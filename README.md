Stockr is a Discord bot that allows its users to track their cryptocurrency assets. Investors can register their transactions to track their profit minute by minute. Its purpose is inspired from the Portfolio feature of Coin Market Cap website.

## How does it work?
The bot is heavily based on the Binance API. Consequently, only markets that Binance show can be tracked. All coin values are considered to be in USDT.

## How to use it?
Invite the bot on your server through [this link](https://discord.com/). Type `stockr?help` to get a list of the available features. Here is an exhaustive list of all the features.

- `stockr?` - shows tracked user assets status
- `stockr?coin <symbol>` - shows value of a specified coin symbol
- `stockr?buy <symbol> <amount> <value>` - adds a buy transaction to be tracked
- `stockr?sell <symbol> <amount> <value>` - adds a sell transaction to be tracked
- `stockr?clear` - clears all tracked user assets
- `stockr?info` - shows bot general information
- `stockr?help` - shows bot help information
